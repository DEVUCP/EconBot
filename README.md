   [Linux (Ubuntu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6_7xaxkPik)

  ~ *if you can't seem to figure out how to do this, you can always just type your token in the code*
example: `client.run("your_token_here")`


# Running

- Open up terminal
- Make sure you're in the root directory (the folder you just cloned)
- Run the bot using
```base
py main.py
```


# Coding conventions
- Folder & file names should be lowercase and `flatcase`.
- Any non-const variables should be in `snake_case`.
- Add comments to the code that explain the purpose of the code, not what it does.
- All `const` variables should be in `MACRO_CASE`.
- All Classes and Methods should be in `PascalCase`. Example: `GetAccountID()`.
- Make sure to use XML documentation with every function.
